## 🔍 What is RAG & Why It Matters

**RAG** stands for **Retrieval-Augmented Generation**.  
It’s the technique that powers most practical GenAI applications like:

- Internal support bots
- Legal policy assistants
- Sales document advisors
- Educational Q&A engines

LLMs like GPT don’t know your private data (PDFs, docs, APIs).  
**RAG solves this** by retrieving *relevant chunks of your custom data* and **injecting them into the LLM prompt** — allowing GPT to respond with grounded, accurate answers.

## 🧠 RAG Architecture: How It Works

```text
User → Query →
     Retriever (Vector DB) →
     Relevant Chunks →
     Prompt Constructor →
     GPT (Answer Generator) →
     Final Answer
```

## Step-by-Step:

1. User enters a question (e.g. “What is the refund policy?”)
2. Convert the query into an embedding
3. Search a vector database for related content chunks
4. Insert those chunks into a prompt template
5. Send to GPT for generating an answer
6. Return the response to the user

## 🧩 Key Concepts Behind RAG

### ✅ Embeddings
- Turns text into vectors (numbers)
- Captures semantic meaning
- Tools: OpenAI Embeddings, Hugging Face, Cohere

### ✅ Vector Databases
- Store vector representations of document chunks
- Perform similarity search (like Google, but with meaning)
- Tools: Pinecone, Weaviate, Chroma, FAISS

### ✅ Chunking Strategy
- Split source documents into small sections (100–500 tokens)
- Must balance:
  - Too small → lacks context
  - Too large → exceeds GPT prompt limits

### ✅ Prompt Engineering
A well-constructed prompt includes:

```text
Answer the question using the context below:
---
[chunk 1]
[chunk 2]
---
Question: What is X?
Answer:
```

## 🛠️ Toolchain for RAG

| Tool          | Purpose                                      |
|---------------|----------------------------------------------|
| 🧠 OpenAI      | Embeddings + GPT for generation              |
| 📦 Pinecone    | Store & retrieve vectorized chunks           |
| 🦜 LangChain   | Manages the RAG pipeline (Retriever + LLM)   |
| ⚙️ n8n         | Visual automation alternative to LangChain   |
| 📝 Your Data   | Markdown, PDFs, or API content as source     |

## 📌 Real-World Use Cases

- **Internal chatbot** trained on company SOPs and policies
- **Customer support bot** using help docs + manuals
- **Sales assistant** answering queries from product data
- **Student assistant** built on textbooks and lecture notes

---

## ✅ Summary

- RAG bridges the gap between **LLMs and your custom data**
- Uses embeddings to **search meaning**, not keywords
- Uses chunked data + prompt templates to build accurate responses
- Combines tools like **LangChain**, **OpenAI**, and **Pinecone**

## 🚀 Next Step – Hands-On Build (Tomorrow)

We’ll build a fully working RAG Chatbot using:

### Option A – LangChain + Python
- Load data (Markdown or WordPress API)
- Create embeddings
- Store in Pinecone
- Create Retriever + Prompt chain
- Build a query interface (Streamlit or CLI)

### Option B – n8n Visual Workflow
- HTTP Request to fetch docs
- JS node to clean and chunk text
- Set node to format metadata
- OpenAI embedding + Pinecone storage
- ChatGPT Q&A workflow
